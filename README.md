Elasticsearch Web Augmented Reality experiment

![Augrmented Reality](https://github.com/derickson/es-ar-experiment/blob/master/2015-08-19-Augmented.jpg?raw=true "Augrmented Reality")

Information is a static data set pulled from a ES nested aggregation query.
Data visualization is a simple bar chart, I'll make that a bit fancier using d3 to auto adjust the bounds etc.

Uses the "threex" and "aruco" libraries which have some BSD and  OpenCV licensed tech.
Uses "three.js" libraries 

Huge shout-out to jeromeetienne for such a great example to follow: https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.webar
